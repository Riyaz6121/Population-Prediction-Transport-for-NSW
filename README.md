# Population-Prediction-Transport-for-NSW
In planning for the future transport needs of NSW, Transport for NSW needs to consider the impacts that transformative projects will have on communities and places. Transformative projects are major investment initiatives that are likely to bring about a “step-change” in the way people travel, including how they travel and where they travel to. These projects also influence where populations live and the businesses locate, often inducing growth in some areas due to the increased accessibility. Examples of transformative projects include high speed rail, heavy rail, metro, light rail, and bus rapid transit.  Transport for NSW requires the development of a methodology and model to calculate the potential change in population that may occur as a result of a transformative project such as Fast Rail for the Sydney to Newcastle corridor. The methodology and model should be guided by best practice from around the world in how population change is calculated for major infrastructure decisions.
